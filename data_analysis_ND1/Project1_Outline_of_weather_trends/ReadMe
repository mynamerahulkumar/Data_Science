Outline of Weather trends:-

I have calculated moving average for 7 days on both chart city data and global data,I
have taken the data from global data file and city data to one file and then calculated
the moving average of each global avg temperature and city avg temperature by using
the formulae ( = AVERAGE(D2:D8) )..
‚óè I want to see the how the city temperature is changing and how it is affecting the global
temperature.I want to see their relationship over the years.So I have taken line chart to show
how my city temperature and global temperature are interrelated
