US BIKE share analysis:-

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity
in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips,
typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of
the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also
provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, i have performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bikeshare
system provider for many major cities in the United States. I have compared  the system
usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see
if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users
and those users that are short-term, casual users.
