I have shown flight delay of airports in USA.I have calculated airport delay by taking average of
departure delay and arrival delay.
We can see that airport code PUB has maximum delay.I have looked down the reason for delay
There are two main reason for flight delay in PUB.
○ NAS DELAY
○ Weather Delay
Nas delay airport authorities and government can controll.It is heavy volume traffic problem.If
government can provide more space to the airport problem can be solved.Weather delay is
natural phenomena.
There are mainly five reason for flight delay.Mostly flight delay caused by Late aircraft
delay,second is NAS delay ,third is carrier delay,4th is Weather delay and last is security Delay
We can see that weather delay is mostly in december and second in july month.Minimum
weather delay is in october and second minimum
We can see that most of the cancellation caused by bad weather .Second most reason for
cancellation is Carrier delay which is almost equal to weather and third NAS.There is no flight
cancellation due to Security
